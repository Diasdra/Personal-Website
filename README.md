# Personal Website built with React.js and styled-components

# How to run it
I used Create React App and then modified it with the help of some tutorials to create my personal webpage. Should be fairly simple to run once downloaded 

- Download Files
- use 'npm start'
- Webpage should start on localhost:3000

# Why did I make this?
This was a useful project to create to teach myself some basic react and how to style it with a library. I also learned things like useState and useEffect. I have a few things I still want to add. Like potentially changing the Hero background to match the weather forecast
